       <p>Hi, my name is Abiel I am an emerging software developer at Year Up. I joined year up to pursue my dream of becoming a professional developer. Growing up I was fascinated about computers and how they function but had no computer of my own until I turned the age of 20. </p>
       <p>I have lived in different parts of East Africa. I was born in Ethiopia, raised in Eritrea, spent my teenage years in Kenya and finished my Highschool years here in Washington. I am lucky to have experienced different cultures growing up. It gives me different perspective in life and be more understanding.  </p>
       <p>My hobbies include working out, boxing, playing soccer with friends, and hiking. Since Washington is surrounded with breathtaking forests and mountains I get to pick and choose where my next adventure will be.</p>
